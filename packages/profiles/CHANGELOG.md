### Patch Changes

- 7073097: Hot-fix v0.1.0's broken `workspace:*` references in published package.json
  files. v0.1.0 leaked the Bun workspace protocol verbatim into published
  tarballs because `changeset publish` (which wraps `npm publish`) does NOT
  rewrite `workspace:*` to concrete semver ranges — that's a pnpm/yarn
  courtesy npm doesn't replicate. As a result, `bun add @mochi.js/core@0.1.0`
  fails with `Workspace dependency not found` for every internal dep
  (behavioral, consistency, inject, net), and the same for the 6 other
  packages with internal deps.

  The fix adds `scripts/rewrite-workspace-deps.ts` as a publish-time
  pre-hook in the root `release` script. Pre-publish, every `workspace:*`
  in `packages/<name>/package.json` is rewritten to `^<sibling-version>`
  resolved from the local workspace map. Bun's workspace links during
  dev still resolve via the `name` field, so concrete versions on disk
  between cycles don't break local development.

  Verified by `bun pack`-ing the affected packages locally and inspecting
  the resulting tarball's `package.json` deps before pushing v0.1.1.

  `@mochi.js/consistency` and `@mochi.js/net-rs` are leaf packages with no
  internal deps; they ship at v0.1.0/0.1.0 already and don't need a bump.
